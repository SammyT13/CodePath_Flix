### Notes
Some of the challenges I encountered had to do more with Xcode itself. Like downloading updates and 
creating storage for it.  Also, editing or deleting from the Main storyboard made more issues than leaving 
the incorrect name.  I had to figure out which outlets to delete and connect.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the challenges I faced was Xcode and the initial download.  I had to 
clear a lot of memory to install it on my mac, which also makes doing updates difficult.  
In Unit 1, it felt like there might have been a video skipped when it came to renaming 
or creating a view controller.  Luckily the internet had a lot of resources.  The last 
obstacle I had was AlamofireImage and the pod files.  The videos were pretty helpful, 
but the written instructions were very hacky.
