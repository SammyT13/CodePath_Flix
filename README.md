### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the challenges I faced was Xcode and the initial download.  I had to 
clear a lot of memory to install it on my mac, which also makes doing updates difficult.  
In Unit 1, it felt like there might have been a video skipped when it came to renaming 
or creating a view controller.  Luckily the internet had a lot of resources.  The last 
obstacle I had was AlamofireImage and the pod files.  The videos were pretty helpful, 
but the written instructions were very hacky.
